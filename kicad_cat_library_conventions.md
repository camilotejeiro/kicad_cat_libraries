KiCad CAT Library Conventions
=============================

_First and Foremost:_
[Regarding KiCad Library Management â€“ No Complaints](https://camilotejeiro.github.io/2016/04/22/regarding-kicad-library-management-no-complaints.html).

_We will try to keep this document up to date and stick with 
[KiCad Library Conventions](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention)._ 
Especially when official standards (e.g. IEEE) are followed (assume KLC unless otherwise noted). 

However, there will be some minor differences based on my experience (completely personal 
choices and these **will** change).

## Use of this document
---

When building components:

1. Follow the guidelines in this document first.

2. Check to make sure you meet compliance with official KLC.

## 1. General Rules
---

_[KLC1 Compliant](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention#1-general-rules)._ 
Plus a couple of other important tips.

**Remember: Abbreviations all caps, otherwise only first letter uppercase.**

* **Always build your personal library on a need to have basis.**  
    Do not build parts you don't need (more parts **does not** mean better 
    libraries). _Otherwise they will go unmaintained and mix with the 
    good parts and clutter your libraries making them useless_

* **Only include in your project the library files you absolutely need in your design.**   
    You don't need hundreds of libraries included in your project when you are
    only using 2 or 3 at most, this is a great way to make mistakes. 
    **Keep your project workspace clean.** 

## 2. Symbol Library names (Naming Conventions)
---

_[KLC2 Compliant](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention#2-symbol-library-names-lib-files)._ 

**Note: only underscores are used for spaces**

* Generic Library Name example: 
    Use the digikey/mouser product categories as a reference.   
    > Product_Category_Only:                    RCL.lib, Bipolar_Transistors_BJT_Single.lib
     
* Manufacturer Library Name Example:  
    > Manufacturer_Specific_Product_Category:   Microchip_PIC16_MCUs.lib

## 3. Symbol Names (Naming Conventions)
---

_[KLC3 Compliant, more specific rules added](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention#3-symbol-names)._ 

**Note: both dashes and underscores are used.** We are not using lower 
case only (see 2016 textpad notes), because symbol, land pattern and 
3d model names follow the convention already: this is supported by KLC.

* Generic schematic Symbol Example:  
    > Schematic-Symbol-Description:               C-POL-US, Q-NPN-BCE or BJT-NPN-BCE
    
* Manufacturer schematic Symbol Example:  
    Always append full part number.  
    > Schematic-Symbol-Description_Part-Number:   OPAMP-W-SUPPLY_MCP6001UT-I/OT

## 4. General Rules for Symbols (Drawing Conventions) 
---

_[KLC4 Compliant](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention#4-general-rules-for-symbols)._ 
Some important sections re-written for clarity.

**Keep them in Imperial units:** This is what is used in standards(IEC-60617), 
plus KiCad Eeschema only has support for imperial units.

* Recommended drawing grid: **50 mils** (default for Eeschema)  
    Preserving all other pin placement and symbol guidelines.

* (1) Pin placement (re-written for clarity) 
    + (i)  Pin placement
        - At 100mils or integer multiples of 100mil (IEC-60617)  
    + (ii) Pin length (min)
        - More than 100 mils  
    + (iii) Pin length (max)
        - Less than 300 mils  
    + (iv) Pin length increments
        - 50 mils   

* (2) Symbol visual style
    + (i) Symbol origin
        - Center of symbol 
    + (ii) Symbol body line with
        - 10 mils  
    + (iii) Symbol body background
        - Fill background     
    + (iv) Symbol standard type
        - IEEE 315-1975  

* Default Drawing width: **10 mils**  
    But you can use any increment of +/-2 mils if really necessary e.g:  
    + 10 mil: default 
    + 8 mil 
    + 6 mil.

* (8) Text fields size: 50 mils for all  
    + (i) Value field  
    + (ii) Reference field  
    + (iii) Footprint field  
    + (iv) Datasheet field  
    + (v) Pin names and numbers field.  

    Always keep them at 50 mils if they clutter the schematic 
    you can reduce the size in the schematic directly (not in 
    the original library symbol)

* Text fields clearance:   
    + If edge to edge: 
        - 10 mils or,  
    + If center to edge of text field: 
        - 15 mils   
    
Also make sure you align the Field text accordingly so that when it expands 
it doesn't overlap with the symbol.

## 5. Footprint Library Naming Conventions (Land Pattern Naming Conventions)
---

_[KLC5 Compliant](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention#5-footprint-library-naming-conventions)._ 

**Note: only underscores are used for spaces.**

* Generic Library Name example: 
    Use the name of the standard Land pattern category (Be specific).    
    > Specific_Land_Pattern_Standard:          RCL_SMD_Chip_IPC.lib.
     
* Manufacturer Library Name Example (Be specific):
    > Manufacturer_Specific_Product_Category:  ON_Semiconductor_Linear_Amplifiers.lib

## 6. Footprint Naming Conventions (Land Pattern Naming Conventions) 
---

_[KLC6 Compliant, more specific rules added](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention#6-footprint-naming-conventions)._ 

**Note: both dashes and underscores are used.** We are not using lower 
case only (see 2016 textpad notes), because symbol, land pattern and 
3d model names follow the convention already: this is supported by KLC.

* Generic Land Pattern Example:  
    > Land-Pattern-Description:               1608M-0603I-Most
    
* Manufacturer Land Pattern Example:  
    Always use full part number.  
    > Land-Pattern-Description_Part-Number:   SOT-23_BC817-40LT3G

## 7. General Rules for Footprints 
---

_[KLC7 Compliant](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention#7-general-rules-for-footprints)._ 
Some important sections re-written for clarity.

**For specific SMD Chip IPC compliant resistors, capacitors or inductors:** 
please refer to your common RCL calculator tool and use those results 
for the individual libraries.

## 8. Rules for Surface Mount Devices (SMD) Footprints (Land Patterns) 
---

_[KLC8 Compliant](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention#8-rules-for-surface-mount-devices-smd-footprints)._ 
Some important sections re-written for clarity.

* (2) Footprint anchor should be placed in the middle of the footprint (IPC-7351). 
    Generally this is the centroid calculated with respect to the device lead ends.
    + (i) If the datasheet specifies an origin for Pick-and-Place, this should be used in preference.

* (3) Pad layer settings:
    + (i) Front copper 
        - F.Cu  
    + (ii) Front Mask
        - F.Mask  
    + (iii) Front paste 
        - F.Paste
 
* Place the pads as per the component datasheet.  

* No local clearances. You will deal with design rules during layout. 

## 9. Rules for Through Hole Technology (THT) Footprints (Land Patterns)
---
_[KLC9 Non-compliant](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention#9-rules-for-through-hole-technology-tht-footprints)._ 
KLC9.2 was modified: land pattern anchor should always be on center, .

* (2) Modified: **Footprint anchor should be set on center. ** Otherwise, layout rotation gets messy (read annoying).   

* (5) Minimum drilled hole diameter is the maximum lead diameter plus 0.20mm (IPC-2222 Class 2)

* (6) Minimum annular ring width should be at least 0.15mm (IPC-2221)

## 10. Footprint properties
---
_[KLC10 Compliant](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention#10-footprint-properties)._ 
Some important sections re-written for clarity.

* (1) Footprint name must match its filename. (.kicad_mod files)  

* (2) Footprint (properties) meta-data should be filled in as appropriate   
    + (i) Documentation field contains comma-separated device information. 
        Where appropriate URL to footprint datasheet should be included
    + Readable meaningful description of footprint.  
        This field is very flexible, use linking words and no abbreviations., 
    + (ii) Keywords field contains space-separated keyword values   
    + Footprint name words with no underscores or dashes (except for 
        manufacturer part name).

* (4) 3D Shape files should be named the same as their footprint and are placed in 
    a folder named the same as the footprint library replacing the .pretty with 
    .3dshapes  
    + (iv) 3D model references should be added even if the model does not yet exist 
        (this helps with library maintenance)
