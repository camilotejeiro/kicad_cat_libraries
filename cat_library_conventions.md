Camilo KiCad Library Conventions
==========================

_First and Foremost:_
[Regarding KiCad Library Management â€“ No Complaints](https://camilotejeiro.wordpress.com/2016/04/21/regarding-kicad-library-management-no-complaints)

_These are largely based on the 
[KiCad Library Conventions](https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention) 
with some minor changes based on my experience (completely personal 
choices and these **will** change)._


## Kicad Schematic Sizes
---

_Keep them in Imperial units: KiCad Eeschema only has support for imperial units._

* Pin width (default wire size):        0.006 inches (6 mils)

* Default Drawing width:                0.008 inches (8 mils)  
    But you can use any increment of 0.002 mils if necessary e.g:
    - 0.006 inches.
    - 0.008 inches. Always default to 8 mils to draw symbol outline.
    - 0.01  inches

* Pin length:                           0.1 inches (100 mils)

* Pin number size:                      0.050 inches (50 mils)

* Pin name size:                        0.050 inches (50 mils)

* Pin placement grid:                   0.1 inches  (100mils)

* Text fields (name and value):         0.050 inches (50 mils)  
    Always keep them at 0.050" if they clutter the schematic 
    you can reduce the size in the board schematic directly (not in 
    the original library symbol)

* Text fields clearance (edge to edge): 0.01 inches (10 mils)  
    15 mils center to edge of text field.

Also make sure you align the Field text accordingly so that when it expands 
it doesnt overlap with the symbol.


## Kicad Schematic Naming Conventions
---

**Abreviations all caps, otherwise only first letter uppercase.**

_We are not using lower case only, because symbol, land pattern and 3d 
model names follow the convention already, so lets stick to it, 
we'll see._

### Library names (sticking to KLC)

*note that only underscores are used for spaces*

* Generic Library Name example: 
    Use the digikey/mouser product categories as a reference.   
    > Product_Category_Only:          RCL.lib, Bipolar_Transistors_BJT_Single.lib
     
* Manufacturer Library Name Example:  
    > Manufacturer_Product_Category:  Microchip_PIC16_MCUs.lib

### Symbol Names 

*note that both dashes and underscores are used*

* Generic schematic Symbol Example:  
    > Schematic-Symbol-Description:               C-POL-US, Q-NPN-BCE
    
* Manufacturer schematic Symbol Example: 
    Always append full part number.  
    > Schematic-Symbol-Description_Part-Number:   OPAMP-W-SUPPLY_MCP6001UT-I/OT


## Kicad Land Pattern Creation Steps (Requirements)
---

_For specific SMD Chip IPC compliant numbers please refer to your 
calculator tool and use those results_

**These are our generic requirements for manufacturer specific parts.**

1. Assembly outline
    - Line width:                               0.15mm

2. Adhesive outline (if applicable)
    - Line width:                               0.01mm
    - Grid increments:                          0.05mm
    - Keep clearance with pad.
    - Adhesive rectangle width less than component width.

3. Component pads.
    - Place the pads as per the component datasheet.
    - No local clearances. You will deal with design rules during layout.

4. Courtyard
    - Line width:                               0.05mm.
    - Courtyard clearance (center to center):   0.25mm

5. Silkscreen Outline (if applicable)
    - line width:                               0.15mm
    - silkscreen clearance:                     0.25mm

6. Text Fields
    - height:                                   1mm
    - width:                                    20%
    - Default Clearance:                        0.25mm    
    - Name field:                               REF**
    - Value field:                              Footprint name.
    - value field is invisible.

7. Footprint properties.
    - Populate the footprint properties.
    - Add 3D model if applicable.

### Library names (sticking to KLC)

*note that only underscores are used for spaces*

* Generic Library Name example: 
    Use the name of the standard Land pattern category (Be specific).    
    > Specific_Land_Pattern_Standard:          RCL_SMD_Chip_IPC.lib.
     
* Manufacturer Library Name Example (Be specific):
    > Manufacturer_Specific_Product_Category:  ON_Semiconductor_Linear_Amplifiers.lib

### Land Pattern Names 

*note that both dashes and underscores are used*

* Generic Land Pattern Example:  
    > Land-Pattern-Description:               1608M-0603I-Most
    
* Manufacturer Land Pattern Example:  
    Always use full part number.  
    > Land-Pattern-Description_Part-Number:   SOT-23_BC817-40LT3G
